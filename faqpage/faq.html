<h1>General</h1>
<h2><span id="What_is_Steemit_com">What is Steemit.com?</span></h2>
<p>Steemit is a social network and content rewards platform that makes the crowd the beneficiaries of the attention economy. It does this be rewarding users with STEEM.</p>
<p>Steemit has redefined social media by building a living, breathing, and growing social economy; a community where users are getting rewarded for sharing their voice.</p>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a></p>
<h2><span id="How_does_Steemit_work">How does Steemit work?</span></h2>
<p>Steemit is a social media platform that works by having the crowd reward the crowd for their content. It does this thanks to the Steem blockchain and cryptocurrency; Steem is 'minted' daily and distributed to content producers according to the votes they get.</p>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a></p>
<h2>How does Steemit differ from other social media websites? <a id="How_does_Steemit_differ_from_other_social_media_websites"></a></h2>
<p>Most social media sites extract value from their userbase for the benefit of shareholders alone. Steemit is different, it's a new kind of attention economy. By connecting with the Steem blockchain (which is decentralized and controlled by the crowd), Steemit users receive all the benefits and rewards for their attention.</p>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a></p>
<h2><span id="Does_it_cost_anything_to_post__comment__or_vote">Does it cost anything to post, comment, or vote?</span></h2>
<p>No. It is free to post, comment, and vote on content on Steemit.com. You might even get paid for it!</p>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a></p>
<h2><span id="Can_I_earn_digital_tokens_on_Steemit_How">Can I earn digital tokens on Steemit? How?</span></h2>
<p>You can earn digital tokens on Steemit by:</p>
<p><strong>Posting</strong> - By sharing your posts, you can earn upvotes from community members. Depending on the upvotes you receive, you will get a portion of the ongoing Steem reward pool.</p>
<p><strong>Voting and curating</strong> - If you discover a post and upvote it before it becomes popular, you can earn a curation reward. The reward amount will depend on the amount of STEEM Power you have.</p>
<p><strong>Purchasing</strong> - Users can purchase STEEM or Steem Dollar tokens directly through the Steemit wallet using bitcoin, Ether, or BitShares tokens. They are also available from other markets and exchanges including BlockTrades, Poloniex, Bittrex, Shapeshift.io, and Changelly. STEEM tokens that are powered up to STEEM Power earn a small amount of interest for holding.</p>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a></p>
<h2><span id="Where_do_the_tokens_come_from">Where do the tokens come from?</span></h2>
<p>The Steem network continually creates digital tokens to reward content creators and curators. Some of the newly-created tokens are transferred to users who add value to Steemit by posting, commenting, and voting on other people's posts. The remainder is distributed to holders of STEEM Power and the witnesses that power the blockchain.</p>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a></p>
<h2><span id="Where_does_the_value_come_from">Where does the value come from?</span></h2>
<p>At its root, Steem is simply a points system. However, because this points system is blockchain-based, the points can be traded on markets as tokens. People buy and sell these tokens, and many hold in anticipation of increased purchasing power for various Steem-related services.</p>
<p>By analogy, Steem is a game system where users compete for attention and rewards by bringing content and adding value to the platform. The rewards people earn are tokens that have market value and are readily tradable. It is similar to how someone playing a video game could obtain a limited item or currency by playing the game. If the currency or items are transferable between users, then they can sell or buy them on game item markets.</p>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a></p>
<h2><span id="Why_are_people_getting_vastly_different_rewards">Why are people getting vastly different rewards?</span></h2>
<p>Steemit is not a "get rich quick" scheme. While it is possible to post content that goes viral quickly and earn a lot of rewards on a single post, this is not typical for most users.</p>
<p>Most of the authors that you see earning high rewards are users that have spent a lot of time in the network building followings, making connections with others, and developing a reputation for bringing high quality content.</p>
<p>It is best to have realistic expectations, without focusing on rewards when you are first starting out. Work on building a following, making connections, and developing a good reputation. Consistency will pay off in the long run.</p>

<p>To create an account on the blockchain, it costs STEEM tokens. When you create an account through Steemit.com, Steemit Inc. is supplying the tokens to pay the account creation fee. In order to prevent users from abusing the paid-for signup and creating multiple accounts, we need to be able to verify that each user is only signing up for one account.</p>

<p>The only way to have an account created via Steemit.com is to supply your email and phone number. Because Steem is an open and permissionless network, there are other ways to create a Steem account. Any Steem blockchain account can be used on Steemit.com</p>

<p>There is a third-party tool called <a href="https://www.SteemCreate.com">SteemCreate</a> that accepts credit cards, or BTC to create a Steem account. You do not need to have an existing Steem blockchain account to use the service, but there is a charge on top of the blockchain account creation fee for using the service.</p>
<p>There is a third-party tool called <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@someguy123/anonsteem-create-anonymous-steem-accounts-without-social-media">AnonSteem</a> that accepts bitcoin, Litecoin, STEEM, or SBD to anonymously create a Steem account.

<h2><span id="Am_I_required_to_verify_my_identity">Am I required to verify my identity?</span></h2>
<p>Verification is a process where users give evidence to show that they are the person that they claim to be.  This is to reduce fraud and people impersonating known figures. If you would like to remain anonymous, that is perfectly fine. However if you claim to be someone specific, the community may expect that you verify you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to do this. The most common way to verify your identity is by posting a link to your Steemit profile on a website or social media account which you are already known for having such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, a blog, or photography site.</p>
<p>Many users also like to post a photo or a video which shows them holding up a sheet of paper with the current date and their Steem account name handwritten on it. This is a great way to add a personal touch to verifying.</p>

<h2><span id="Where_do_the_new_STEEM_tokens_come_from">Where do the new STEEM tokens come from?</span></h2>
<p>Blockchains like Steem and Bitcoin produce new tokens each time a block is produced. Unlike Bitcoin, where all of the new coins go to the block producers (called miners), the Steem blockchain allocates a majority of the new tokens to a reward fund. The reward fund gives users tokens for participating in the platform.</p>

<h2><span id="How_many_new_tokens_are_generated_by_the_blockchain">How many new tokens are generated by the blockchain?</span></h2>
<p>Starting with the network's 16th hard fork in December 2016, Steem began creating new tokens at a yearly inflation rate of 9.5%. The inflation rate decreases at a rate of 0.01% every 250,000 blocks, or about 0.5% per year. The inflation will continue decreasing at this pace until the overall inflation rate reaches 0.95%. This will take about 20.5 years from the time hard fork 16 went into effect.</p>

<h2><span id="How_are_the_new_tokens_distributed">How are the new tokens distributed?</span></h2>
<p>Out of the new tokens that are generated:</p>
<ul>
<li>75% go to the reward pool, which is split between authors and curators.</li>
<li>15% of the new tokens are awarded to holders of STEEM Power.</li>
<li>The remaining 10% pays for the witnesses to power the blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a></p>
<h2><span id="What_is_the_reward_pool">What is the reward pool?</span></h2>
<p>Every day, a fixed amount of STEEM tokens are allocated to the network reward fund, commonly called the "reward pool." These get distributed to authors and curators for posting and voting on content.</p>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a></p>
<h2><span id="How_is_the_reward_pool_split_between_authors_and_curators">How is the reward pool split between authors and curators?</span></h2>
<p>Up to 25% of a post's payout is awarded to curators (the people who upvoted the post) as a reward for discovering the content. The other 75% is awarded to the author. If curators vote for a post within the first 30 minutes of it being created, a portion of their curation reward is added to the author payout. This portion is linear to the age of the post between 0 and 30 minutes. Therefore upvoting at 15 minutes old will donate half of your potential curation reward to the author.</p>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a></p>
<h2><span id="Will_the_reward_pool_pay_out_more_or_less_depending_on_who_votes">Will the reward pool pay out more or less depending on who votes?</span></h2>
<p>There is a fixed amount of STEEM coins that gets added to the rewards pool each day. In the short term, the amount of coins that get paid out may be higher or lower depending on the amount of voting activity, but over time it will pay out the full amount of rewards regardless of who votes.</p>
<p>Votes in Steem are stake-weighted. Therefore voters with more STEEM Power have a greater influence over the allocation than voters with less SP, but their votes do not increase the amount of rewards.</p>

<h2><span id="What_is_the_difference_between_STEEM__STEEM_Power__and_Steem_Dollars">What is the difference between STEEM, STEEM Power, and Steem Dollars?</span></h2>
<p><strong>STEEM</strong> - STEEM is the base liquid currency token in the platform. STEEM can be powered up into STEEM Power, traded for Steem Dollars, and transferred to other accounts. It is a cryptocurrency token, similar to bitcoin.</p>
<p><strong>STEEM Power</strong> - STEEM Power (abbreviated SP) is a measurement of how much influence a user has in the Steem network. The more STEEM Power a user holds, the more they can influence the value of posts and comments. STEEM Power is less liquid. If a user wishes to “Power Down” SP, they will receive equal distributions of the STEEM weekly, over a 13 week period.</p>
<p><strong>Steem Dollars</strong> - Steem Dollars (commonly abbreviated SBD) are liquid stable-value currency tokens designed to be pegged to $1 USD. Steem Dollars can be traded with STEEM, and transferred to other accounts for commerce or exchange.  Steem Dollars may also be converted into STEEM in a process that takes 3.5 days. Steem Dollars can be used to buy things in marketplaces, such as PeerHub.com.</p>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a></p>
<h2><span id="What_is_delegated_STEEM_Power">What is delegated STEEM Power?</span></h2>
<p>Users have the option to delegate STEEM Power to other users. When a user is delegated STEEM Power, their content votes and curation rewards are calculated as if it were their own STEEM Power. Users are not able to power down or cash out delegated STEEM Power, as it still belongs to the original owner.</p>
<p>Most users will have a small amount of STEEM Power delegated to them by the Steemit account after creating an account via Steemit.com.</p>
<p>Delegated STEEM Power shows up in a user's wallet below their actual STEEM Power balance in parentheses.</p>

<h2><span id="What_determines_the_price_of_STEEM">What determines the price of STEEM?</span></h2>
<p>The price of STEEM is based on the supply and demand of the token, determined by buyers and sellers on the exchanges. It is similar to how the price of a commodity like gold is determined.</p>

<h2><span id="How_do_I_get_more_STEEM_Power">How do I get more STEEM Power?</span></h2>
<p>With STEEM tokens in your wallet, click "Power Up" to turn them into STEEM Power. If you have Steem Dollars, you can convert them to STEEM from your wallet, and then power up the STEEM.</p>
<p>If you don’t already have STEEM or Steem Dollars in your wallet, you can purchase them using bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), or BitShares (BTS) tokens. You may purchase BTC on various exchanges, such as Coinbase.com or Localbitcoins.com.</p>
<p>To buy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click "Buy Steem" from the main menu in the top right corner of Steemit.com, or from your wallet.</li>
<li>Select the currency to deposit, and enter the amount of that currency you wish to use.</li>
<li>Enter your Steemit account name (without the @) for "Your receive address".</li>
<li>Click the "Get Deposit Address" button.</li>

<p>Transactions on the Steem blockchain typically only take about three seconds to process, but when you are purchasing the STEEM tokens using bitcoin or some other token, then the transaction must wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the other network. This can often take several hours, and sometimes even days.</p>
<p>If you paid using bitcoin, the third party website <a href="https://bitcoinfees.21.co/">bitcoinfees.21.co</a> can estimate the approximate wait time of the transaction based on the fees that were paid. The third party website <a href="https://blockchain.info/">blockchain.info</a> will lookup the fees that were paid on a specific blockchain transaction.</p>

<h2><span id="What_is_powering_up_and_down">What is powering up and down?</span></h2>
<p><strong>Powering up</strong> - If you have STEEM tokens, you can Power Up to STEEM Power to get more voting influence on posts and comments. Having more STEEM Power also increases the amount of curation rewards and interest that you can earn. More SP also grants more influence on approving Steem witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Powering down</strong> - If you have STEEM Power, you can power down to turn it into liquid STEEM over a period of time. The system will transfer 1/13 of your STEEM Power to STEEM each week for about three months (13 weeks), starting 1 week from the time it is started. However, you will lose your influence in the network proportionally to how much is powered down, so think about it carefully. Power downs can be stopped at any time.</p>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a></p>
<h2><span id="What_do_the_dollar_amounts_for_pending_payouts_represent">What do the dollar amounts for pending payouts represent?</span></h2>
<p>The dollar amounts next to posts and comments are estimates of the potential payout that will occur when the payout period ends, based on the current voting activity and price of STEEM. These potential payout amounts may fluctuate up or down until the payout period ends.</p>
<p>Payouts occur as a combination of STEEM Power and Steem Dollars. Sometimes the blockchain may substitute STEEM in place of the Steem Dollars based on market conditions.</p>
<p>The blockchain estimates the dollar value of STEEM and STEEM Power based on the 3.5 day average price of STEEM reported by the witnesses. The blockchain assumes Steem Dollars are worth approximately one USD.</p>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a></p>
<h2><span id="Will_1_Steem_Dollar_always_be_worth__1_00_USD">Will 1 Steem Dollar always be worth $1.00 USD?</span></h2>
<p>The market value of a Steem Dollar is dictated by the supply and demand of the token. Therefore it is possible for 1 SBD to be worth more or less than 1 USD depending on market conditions. However, the network's SBD conversion feature serves as a mechanism to hold Steem Dollars within a small margin of the value of USD.</p>
<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a></p>
<h2><span id="How_do_Steem_Dollar_to_STEEM_conversions_work">How do Steem Dollar to STEEM conversions work?</span></h2>
<p>If you convert Steem Dollars to STEEM on the Wallet page, the blockchain will process the transaction over a period of 3.5 days. At the end of the 3.5 days, the SBD will be gone and replaced by approximately $1 USD worth of STEEM tokens. The "approximately 1 USD worth of STEEM tokens" is based on the median STEEM price over the 3.5 days, using the price feeds from the Steem witnesses. Depending on price fluctuations during the 3.5 days it is possible to end up with more or less than $1 USD worth of STEEM per SBD at the end of the conversion.</p>

<p>You can exchange them. Visit the internal Market, found in the main menu. There you can exchange your SBD for STEEM in real-time at whatever the current market price is.</p>

<p>Voting power is like an "energy bar" in a computer game that goes down a little bit every time you vote. You start out with 100% voting power. Every time you vote, you will use a small amount of your voting power.</p>
<p>As you use more of your voting power, your votes will carry less influence. A vote with 50% voting power left will be worth 1/2 as much as a vote cast with 100% voting power. Not to worry, the network recharges your voting power by 20% every day.</p>

<h2><span id="How_many_times_can_I_vote_without_depleting_my_voting_power">How many times can I vote without depleting my voting power?</span></h2>
<p>Every 100% vote you cast will use 2% of your remaining voting power. Your voting power will recharge by 20% each day. You can vote more than 10 times per day, but each vote will be worth less, and it will take longer to reach full voting power again.</p>

<p>Once you reach about 500 STEEM Power, you will see a vote slider appear when you vote. You can use the slider to adjust the weight of your vote, between 1% and 100% voting strength. Voting with less than 100% voting weight will use up less voting power, but it will also have less of an influence on the post or comment's rewards.</p>

<p>Of the 25% that goes to the curator, that portion will be split between the author and the curator if the curator votes within the first 30 minutes. The split of the 25% between the author and curator during the first 30 minutes is calculated linearly based on the time the vote is cast.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a post is upvoted the moment of posting, 100% of the curation reward goes to the author.</li>
<li>At 3 minutes, 90% goes to the author and 10% to the curator.</li>
<li>At 15 minutes it's a 50/50 split.</li>

<p>A user with more SP is going to have a larger influence on the rewards than users with less SP. One vote from a user with a lot of SP can often have more of an effect than 100 votes from users with a small amount of SP.</p>
<p>Even though your vote may not have an immediate effect, when it gets added in along with all the other votes at the end of the payout period, it can still affect the payout. It may also cause more users to vote on the post too, because they saw that you upvoted it - so your votes can have an indirect effect on the payout this way.</p>
